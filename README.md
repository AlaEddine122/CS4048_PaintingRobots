# CS4048_PaintingRobots

Collaborative painting robots. These robots would interact with a 2D square grid and would be tasked to recreate a predefined map image. For example a red robot would be tasked to move and paint its required squares red, and a blue robot would be tasked to do the same for its squares. We'd like to add some element of cooperation between these robots, so to make purple, both the red robot and the blue robot would be required to be on the same square at the same time, hence requiring some communication between them. We'd like to add other elements like this, like a refill station which only one robot can use at a time, and so some scheduling between the two to avoid waiting queues.
